# RAG
This is a simple streamlit project to apply the Large Language Model (LLM) retrieving the context of the given document and generating the answer in Vietnamese language.
The LLM being used in the project is Bloomz-560m from BigScience. However, we can also implement Tiny Llama or even Vicuna for better performance in processing Vietnamese language.
